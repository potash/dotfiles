   Description:

     This file applies to XTerm a set of symbolic constants assumed to
     be defined by the user (`FONT' and `FONT_BOLD') and by a color
     theme (the `COLOR_' ones).

   Usage:

     1. Put this file somewhere in your home directory.  You might
        want to create a separate directory, e.g., `~/.xrdb/', in
        which to put all X resource files.

     2. Uncomment the lines you like in the ``Suggested Settings''
        section below.

     3. Obtain an xrdb color theme compatible with this file.  The
        only one I currently know about is `look-zenburn.xrdb' (see
        below for a link).

     4. Define `FONT' and `FONT_BOLD' in your main X resource file
        (most likely `~/.Xdefaults' or `~/.Xresources').  Personally,
        I have the following two lines at the top:

          #define FONT       -*-lucy-medium-*-*-*-10-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
          #define FONT_BOLD  -*-lucy-bold-*-*-*-10-*-*-*-*-*-*-*

        You can find a link to the Lucy font files below.  The Lucy
        fonts currently only come in size 10.  If this is too small
        for your taste, I suggest Lucida Typewriter, from which Lucy
        is (most likely illegally) derived.  Simply substitute
        `lucidatypewriter' for `lucy' and `12' for `10'.

     5. Put the line `#include "~/.xrdb/xterm.xrdb"' in your main X
        resource file, *below* the other ones you just added.

     6. Restart your X session or run `xrdb -load <resource-file>',
        where <resource-file> is your main X resource file.

     7. Restart your XTerms.
